a little bit lay him in a shaytan al

rajim bismillah al rahman al rahim

allahu allah who I had Allah Allah made

me a lead while mu that when a miracle

of Oh Khufu went ahead rubbish Allah so

they were silly and really looked at a

mili sandy of cocoa leaf and handling

lava salat wa salam or another so Allah

Allah Allah he was a huge man from

alibag once again everybody Salam o

aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato

I want to start introducing so to the

class to you but first of all by saying

that the Prophet SAW time had a special

love for this surah the most beloved of

the prayers it seems in the Quran that's

highlighted like no other prayer is the

Fajr prayer Allah calls it or Arnold

Fetchit the word Quran is not attributed

with any other prayer the way that the

Fajr prayer is that's why it's called

called an effigy the Quran of fuzzier

time the Prophet Solomon the son a

prayer of our Father would regularly

recite so today class and social sort of

caffeine on so both of these tools you

will recite very very regularly on top

of that there are several not one

several occasions in which the prophets

I said I'm in one way or the other

described the surah as a third of the

Quran this is important not just because

that's a reinforced concept in other

words okay fine

and its value reciting at once it's like

you recited a third of the Quran it's

actually also important that the

prophets I said kept reinforcing that he

kept saying it over and over and over

again this is a telling thing because

the prophesy sham doesn't do this

regularly for so many other sutras you

don't find lots and lots of narrations

about a surah over and over and over

again but you do that do you find that

for this surah in particular and it's

perhaps because of that emphasis that

you find this curious hadith that I'll

read on to you that the Prophet SAW

Allah came across a person can i

acquiesce habibi's Latium for yesterday

maybe Cole who Allah who had

phenomenological Italica do so solemn

there was a man who used to read lead

the prayer and every rakah he finished

he would finish it with canto Allahu

Ahad like he would pray to Allah word

all the time and so salut holy ie

shiniest Nanak

as I said go ask him why does he do that

for what purpose does he does he recite

the the class all the time for coldly

and Nahas a fat old man he said because

it's its attributes

it describes the most merciful even

though the world our Batman isn't here

this man saw the sort of the class has

the the mercy and the love of Allah

encapsulated in it so fertile mind for

now cannot be huh so that's why I love

that I read the prayer with it remind

people of the love and care and the

essential qualities of a man of Allah

for Colorado sued Allah he's a little on

re4 them a beautiful and allaha yuhibbu

who the prophesy subside go tell him

Allah loves him tell that person Allah

loves him so his love of his loss led to

Allah love in him so we should have a

special love for so to the class so the

question arises what's so special about

the class I mean it seems like it's

teaching a really basic lesson allah is

one he doesn't have children nor was he

begotten done nothing can be compared to

him seems like very simple basic

concepts of talking so what's the big

deal of that sort on a class you should

understand something here the Quran

teaches three fundamental beliefs the

Quran teaches about God the Quran

teaches about the afterlife and the

Quran teaches about revelation three

things basically every other belief

falls in one way or the other under

these three you know Iman Bela Iman de

la cara Amanda la sala faith a lot faith

in God faith in the afterlife faith and

revelation you know even if we say we

believe in angels it's the angels who

deliver revelation it's the unseen right

we once once we say we believe in Allah

it's all of his names all of his

attributes all of his doings when we

believe in the afterlife it includes

what happens in the grave Judgment Day

heaven hell all of it right so if you

look at it that way one third of those

is just belief in Allah and I believe in

Allah summed up better here than

anywhere else in the Quran if you

understand what this was saying then

you're good to go

you've you've accomplished one third of

those essential fates and actually the

other two are only a necessary

consequence of this first one you will

only truly believe in the afterlife if

you believe in God and you can only

truly believe in Revelation if you

believe in Allah to begin with so the

other two are actually spawned out of

this faith the faith in Allah that's one

thing and the other thing that I feel is

equally important is its placement you

know

when people start out on a project on a

task and they've been struggling to

accomplish victory and get somewhere

with it for a long time along the way as

you gain more and more victory it's easy

to lose sight of why you started where

you started and why the Muslims have had

many battles with depeche they've gone

to conflict multiple times they've gone

back and forth and now finally Islam is

going to be victorious and one day when

it's victorious you might lose why were

we fighting was it for territory was it

so we could break idols because I became

us versus them not us for a Cause our

cause has not versus them our causes

something much greater and our cause was

is and always will be the unique fate of

faith in this unique unparalleled God

the oneness of Allah why are we trying

to liberate the Kaaba so s loss is

established to Allah people only and

only worship Allah so after describing

ilaha ilallah well fought after opening

the door say that victory by getting rid

of Abu Lahab now Allah says never lose

sight of your goal why are you believers

to begin with why are you struggling to

begin with what is the entire life of

the Prophet so I saw them culminate in

it culminates in instilling this sincere

love and loyalty and worship to Allah in

every human beings heart that's why the

capital was liberated and that's why

social class is so so important and

that's in a sense why the Prophet SAW

student would keep reminding the

believers of the surah because it

reminds them why they are Muslim to

begin with what this Deen is all about

it's about their relationship directly

with Allah from you know if I was giving

a lecture on this surah all-out I

describe to you the remarkable

linguistics of this surah I mean it is

absolutely fascinating from a

grammatical point of view that the word

Allah is followed by the word I had done

you know and then the word Allah is

repeated again Allah who summit and then

there's no Alessi there's no SML so

instead of saying Allah who so i'ma do

let e let me read but I'm you that it

breaks off and says let me a little

amulet but that's for another time

insha'Allah Allah for now all I want to

share with you is you know why is it

called Sultana class the word a classes

in in the surah the world class is not

in the surah this surah is actually

about refining your faith in God and

purifying that faith and

we're learning is the more you're in

your mind in your heart that concept of

what lies refined the more sincere you

will become in everything that you do

may allah azza wajal grant us all

sincerity in everything that we do

barakallahu li walakum wa-salaamu

alaikum warahmatullahi wa laqad
